Three.js-Object-Rotation-with-Quaternion
========================================

Example of rotating an object, not camera, using quaternion rotation.

I was looking for ways to rotate an object, not the camera, in a 3d scene using a trackball like control. I found code on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23223431/how-to-rotate-object-in-three-jsr66-not-use-trackball-which-is-control-the-cam) which was very close to what I was looking for. This is that example code updated to work more like I wanted.

**The rotation now works as I expect. Phew.**

**Now with momentum** Try spinning the cube fast.

Putting this code out there in case it helps anyone or could be improved.
